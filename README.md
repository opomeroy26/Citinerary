## Backend
This application's backend was built with Ruby on Rails. After cloning, the backend can be launched by runing `rails db:migrate` to set up the database, `rails db:seed` to seed some initial seed data, and `bundle install` to install the necessary dependencies. Finally, you can run `rails s` to launch the server.
